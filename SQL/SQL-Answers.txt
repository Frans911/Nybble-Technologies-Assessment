SQl :

1. SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races) This query will return an empty set, It is all due to the set being evaluated by the SQL NOT IN condition contains any values that are null,
    then the outer query here will return an empty set, even if there are many runner ids that match winner_ids in the races table
-Alternativley you can use this query to ignore the nulls in column(winner_id) : SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races WHERE winner_id IS NOT NULL);

2.SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy <> 2  This query returns only one set: Pat Richards, even though there are 4 customers not referred by Jane Smith (including Jane Smith herself). In SQL Server,
    however, if ReferredBy is NULL, neither of them are true and neither of them are false. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value in three-valued logic: UNKNOWN.
-Alternatively you can use this query : SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy <> 2 or ReferredBy is null
